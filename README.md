# Consumer-Behavior-Analysis
The project aims to uncover patterns, preferences, and potential opportunities for product optimization and targeted marketing strategies within the FMCG sector, specifically analyzing chip brands. This repository contains the code and analysis for the BAMA 517 Marketing Capstone Project, focusing on comprehensive data analysis and insights generation from retail transaction and customer purchase behavior datasets

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to apply marketing analytics techniques to real-world datasets to:

Understand consumer purchase behaviors.
Identify key drivers of purchase decisions.
Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.
Recommend strategies for targeted marketing and product placement.
Datasets
The analysis utilizes two main datasets:

QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv: Contains data on customer purchase behaviors including loyalty card number, age group, marital status, and purchasing category.
QVI_transaction_data.xlsx: Includes detailed transaction data such as product name, package size, purchase quantity, and transaction time.
# Methodology
The project follows a structured data analysis approach:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing data to handle missing values, correct anomalies, and prepare datasets for analysis.
Data Integration: Merging purchase behavior and transaction datasets for a unified view of customer transactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from product names and transaction details to facilitate deeper analysis.
Customer Segmentation: Using clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
Insight Generation: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis to inform marketing strategies.
# Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
